# SPLAT

SPLAT (Simultaneous Proteome Localization and Turnover)  is a method to simultaneously quantify
protein translocation and turnover rates in vivo. This repository provides a workflow to process
tandem mass tag (TMT) and stable isotopic labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) mass
spectrometry data generated in SPLAT experiments. The SPLAT method is described in detail in our preprint.
Please see the Documentations for more information.
